        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Decided to try and put some writing up on the internet, so I have purchased <a href="https://writing.brianbar.net/">this domain</a> and set it all up using a static site generator called <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexo</a> and have used a great theme called <a href="https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cactus</a>.</p><p>Hopefully, getting this all set up will encourage me to share some writing with anyone unfortunate enough to come across it!</p><p>I’m on the <a href="https://twitter.com/brian3kb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, and may also cross-post some stuff to Medium, but haven’t decided on that yet.</p><p>Thanks for visiting!</p>]]></content>
